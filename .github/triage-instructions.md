**Framework & versions:** Django 4.2 · SQLite · Python 3.x  
**No frontend framework** — plain Django templates.  
**Crash detection:** Sentry SDK via `SENTRY_DSN`; the Sentry GitHub integration creates a GitHub Issue which triggers this triage workflow.

---

## 2 · Reading the Sentry Culprit Field

Sentry sets `culprit` in one of these formats:

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `module.path in function` | `tasks.views in delete_task` | `tasks/views.py`, function `delete_task` |
| `module.path` | `tasks.models` | `tasks/models.py`, module-level code |
| `package.module in Class.method` | `tasks.views in TaskViewSet.destroy` | `tasks/views.py`, method `destroy` on `TaskViewSet` |

**Conversion rule:** replace every `.` with `/`, append `.py`, then strip the `in …` suffix for the file path.
---

## 2a · Extracting Crash Details from the GitHub Issue Body

Crash details now arrive as a GitHub Issue created by Sentry's native GitHub
integration (bot login: `sentry-io[bot]`). The structured `workflow_dispatch`
inputs no longer exist — you must parse the relevant fields from free text.

### Crash title
Use the **GitHub issue title** verbatim. It is set by Sentry to the exception
type and message, e.g. `KeyError: 'pending'`.

### Sentry URL
Scan the issue body for the first URL that matches `https://sentry.io/`.
This is the direct link to the Sentry issue's event detail page.

### Severity level
Look for one of the words `fatal`, `error`, or `warning` (case-insensitive)
in the issue body. If none is found, default to `error`.

### Culprit file and function
The culprit typically appears in the issue body in one of these forms:

| Pattern in body | Extraction |
|-----------------|------------|
| `tasks/views.py in delete_task` | file = `tasks/views.py`, fn = `delete_task` |
| `tasks.views in delete_task` | apply dot→slash + `.py` rule from §2 |
| A code block or stack trace line like `File "tasks/views.py", line 42, in delete_task` | file = `tasks/views.py`, fn = `delete_task` |

Steps:
1. Search the body for a line containing `in <identifier>` near a file path or module path.
2. Apply the conversion rule from §2 to obtain the file path and function name.
3. Verify the file exists in the repository (`ls <file_path>`).

### Fallback — culprit cannot be identified
If after the steps above you still cannot confidently identify the culprit file:
1. Extract the **exception type** from the crash title (e.g. `KeyError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).
2. Search the codebase: `grep -rn "raise \|except " tasks/ --include="*.py"` and look for code that could raise that exception type.
3. Cross-reference with the Sentry URL (open it if possible) for the full stack trace.
4. Narrow to the most plausible function, state your reasoning in the PR description, and proceed with the fix.

## 3 · Investigation Checklist — Complete Every Step

### Step 1 — Locate the culprit

1. Extract crash details from the GitHub issue body using the guidance in **§2a**.
2. Parse the culprit using the table in **§2** to get `<file_path>` and `<function_name>`.
3. Read the entire file (`cat <file_path>`).
4. Find the exact function/method.  If the function is not in that file, search: `grep -rn "def <function_name>" .`

### Step 2 — Understand the crash

Answer all three questions before writing a single line of code:

- **What is the operation?** (database query, attribute access, arithmetic, HTTP call, …)
- **What is the failure mode?** (KeyError, AttributeError, ZeroDivisionError, DoesNotExist, …)
- **What guard is missing or what assumption is violated?**

### Step 3 — Check git history

```bash
git log --oneline -20 -- <file_path>
```

- Identify commits that touched the crash site.
- Note any commit that removed a guard, changed a default, or altered the function signature.

### Step 4 — Check for related open issues / PRs

Search open issues for keywords from the crash title and culprit module.

- If a **duplicate** already has an open PR — add a comment to that PR with the new Sentry crash URL and **stop here**.
- If a duplicate issue has **no PR** — continue and reference that issue in your PR.

### Step 5 — Apply the fix

Rules:
- Make the **smallest correct change** possible.
- Match the existing code style exactly (see §4 below).
- Do NOT add new packages unless absolutely necessary; if you must, add them to `requirements.txt` with a pinned version.
- Do NOT modify unrelated files, refactor unrelated code, or change formatting outside the fix.

### Step 6 — Verify locally (mental or shell check)

- Trace through the fixed code path with the inputs that caused the crash.
- Confirm the guard/fix prevents the exception.
- Check that normal (non-crashing) inputs still work correctly.

## 4 · Code Style Reference

This project follows standard Django conventions. Match what you see:

```python
# views.py pattern — all task views follow this shape:
@require_POST
def action_name(request, task_id):
    task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id)
    # … minimal logic …
    return redirect('index')
```

- Use `get_object_or_404` when looking up by primary key — never raw `.get()` without a try/except.
- Single blank line between top-level functions.
- Docstrings: `"""One-line description."""` format (matches existing views).
- No f-strings with complex expressions — keep them simple.

---

## 5 · PR Requirements (Mandatory)

### Branch name
```
fix/sentry-<slugified-crash-title>
```
Example: `fix/sentry-zerodivisionerror-delete-task`  
Slugify rule: lowercase, replace spaces and special chars with `-`, max 60 chars.

### PR must be a **draft** PR
Set `draft: true` in the API call. The human reviewer will mark it ready for review.

### PR title
```
fix: <crash title> (Sentry auto-triage)
```

### PR description — use this exact template

```markdown
## 🔴 Sentry Crash Fix

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Crash title** | <title from GitHub issue> |
| **Culprit** | `<culprit extracted from issue body>` |
| **Severity** | <level extracted from issue body> |
| **Sentry URL** | [View crash](PASTE_FULL_SENTRY_HTTPS_URL_HERE_NO_ANGLE_BRACKETS) |
| **Triage issue** | Closes #<GitHub issue number that triggered this workflow> |

> **IMPORTANT for Sentry URL**: Replace `PASTE_FULL_SENTRY_HTTPS_URL_HERE_NO_ANGLE_BRACKETS` with the raw full URL exactly as extracted, e.g. `https://demo3n.sentry.io/organizations/...`. Do NOT wrap it in angle brackets `<>`. The format must be exactly `[View crash](https://...)` with no extra parentheses or brackets.

## 6 · Hard Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| ❌ No auto-merge | The PR must be a **draft**. Never mark it ready or merge it. |
| ❌ No issue as output | Do not open a new GitHub Issue. The issue that triggered you is the task brief — your only output is a draft PR. |
| ❌ No unrelated changes | If you notice other bugs while reading the code, do not fix them in this PR. |
| ❌ No new migration without a note | If your fix requires a schema change, call it out explicitly in the PR description and label it `needs-migration-review`. |
| ✅ Always reference Sentry URL | Include the Sentry URL (extracted from the issue body) in the PR description so the reviewer can see the real stack trace. |
| ✅ Always reference the triggering issue | Use `Closes #<N>` in the PR body so the GitHub issue is auto-closed when the PR merges. |

## 7 · Manual Issue Template

Human engineers may open a triage issue manually when a crash is not reported
by the Sentry bot. The agent must recognise the format below and process it
identically to a Sentry bot issue (with confidence tracking per §2a).

```markdown
## Issue Type
<!-- Choose one: Bug / Crash / Data Issue / Config Issue -->
Type: {type}

## Exception / Error
<!-- The full exception class and message, e.g. KeyError: 'ticket_id' -->
Exception: {ExceptionClass: message}

## Culprit
<!-- File path and function, e.g. tasks/views.py in delete_task -->
Culprit: {file_path in function_name}

## Severity
<!-- fatal / error / warning -->
Severity: {severity}

## Description
<!-- What happened, when, which instance/subdomain was affected -->
{free text}

## Stack Trace (if available)
```
{paste stack trace here}
```
```

**Required markers for detection:** `Type:`, `Exception:`, `Culprit:` — all
three must be present in the issue body for Path B triage to activate.

**Partial-data handling:** If any field is missing, triage proceeds with reduced
confidence. The agent must explicitly state:
- Which fields were missing
- What assumptions were made to fill the gaps
- The overall confidence level (High / Medium / Low) per the rules in Step 2

---

## 8 · Fix Action Classification

After root cause analysis, classify the crash on two axes before deciding
whether to open a PR or post a remediation comment.

### Axis 1 — Root cause category

| Category | Description | Fix action |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Code defect** | Missing guard, wrong logic, unhandled exception path, type error, off-by-one, bad default | **Category B** — open a code PR |
| **Data/state issue** | Corrupt record, unexpected null, missing FK, stale cache, bad migration data | **Category A** — ops remediation |
| **Race condition** | Concurrent requests, missing lock, non-atomic multi-step operation | **Category A** — ops remediation |
| **External dependency failure** | Third-party API down, DB connection refused, storage error | **Category A** — ops remediation |

### Axis 2 — Data/state sub-cause (apply when Axis 1 = Data/state issue)

| Sub-cause | Remediation approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Corrupt or missing record | Run a data-repair script |
| Stale cache entry | Flush specific cache key or namespace |
| Bad migration data | Run a one-off data migration or fixup script |
| Unexpected null from external sync | Re-trigger sync job or patch record |

### Label to apply

| Category | GitHub label |
|----------|-------------|
| Category A | `ops-remediation-needed` |
| Category B | `sentry-triage-code-fix` |

---

## 9 · Impact Level Classification

Use these criteria when writing the Impact Analysis comment (Step 7 of the
workflow):

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | Crash affects task creation, CSV export, or overall data integrity of the task list |
| **High** | Crash affects a core view: `index`, `add_task`, `toggle_task`, `delete_task`, or `export_tasks_csv` |
| **Medium** | Crash affects a secondary view (`search_tasks`, `task_detail`) or an edge-case input to a core view |
| **Low** | Crash affects a rare code path, a cosmetic issue, or an admin-only operation |

Always state which criterion was matched and why.

---

## 10 · Deduplication Check Instructions

Run all three checks **before** performing any root cause analysis.

### Check 1 — Open issue deduplication
Search open issues using the exception class name from the crash title as the
query string. Compare title and culprit module:
- **Exact match** (same exception class + same module): post a duplicate comment
  and stop.
- **Partial match** (same exception class, different module): continue triage
  but note the related issue in the impact analysis comment.

### Check 2 — Open PR deduplication
Search `fix/sentry-` branches and open PR titles for the exception class or
culprit function name. If an open PR exists:
- Post a comment on the new issue: `"An open PR already addresses this crash: #<pr_number>."`
- Stop. Do not open a second PR.

### Check 3 — Recently merged PR check
Search merged PRs from the last 30 days for the exception class. If found:
- Do NOT stop — the fix may not be deployed.
- Add a warning note to the impact analysis comment.
- Reduce triage confidence by one level (High → Medium, Medium → Low).

## 11 · Regression Detection Instructions

A regression is defined as: a crash that is directly traceable to a specific
code change in the last 30 commits that removed a guard, changed a default, or
altered function behaviour.

### Detection procedure

1. After running `git log --oneline -15 -- <culprit_file>`, examine each commit
   that touched the crashing function.
2. For each candidate commit, run:
   ```bash
   git show <hash> -- <culprit_file>
   ```
   Look for: removal of a `try/except`, removal of an `if` guard, a changed
   default value, a changed method signature, or a removed `.get()` fallback.
3. If such a commit is found, set `REGRESSION_DETECTED=true`.

### Metadata to collect

```bash
git log --format="%H %ae %an %ad %s" --date=short -1 <hash>
```

Extract:
- `commit_hash` — full SHA
- `github_username` — derive from the author email if it is a
  `@users.noreply.github.com` address (format: `<id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com`);
  otherwise use the author name as a best-effort handle
- `commit_date` — the author date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `pr_number` — search merged PRs for the commit hash; if not found, write "not found"

### Effect on the PR

When `REGRESSION_DETECTED=true`:
1. Add label `potential-regression` to the issue.
2. Include the `## Regression Detection` section in the PR description (see
   Step 11 of the workflow).
3. Request review from `@{github_username}` in addition to `ramya-co/ops-team`.

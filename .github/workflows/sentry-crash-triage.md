# Sentry Crash Auto-Triage

You are a senior Django engineer. A production crash has been detected and
reported as a GitHub Issue. Your job is to **find the root cause, classify the
fix action, apply a minimal targeted fix when needed, and open a draft Pull
Request** for human review.

**You must never auto-merge. You must never open a new GitHub Issue as output.**

---

## Step 0 — Detect and validate the issue source

### Gate 1 — Determine path

The workflow has already been activated by the infrastructure-level bot check
(`bots: [sentry-io[bot], sentry[bot]]` in the workflow frontmatter) or by team-membership
check for human reporters. Your job here is only to determine **which path**
to follow.

Read the full body of issue `${{ github.event.issue.number }}`.

### Path A — Sentry bot issue
The issue was opened by `sentry-io[bot]` or `sentry[bot]` (i.e. `${{ github.actor }}`
matches either bot login or contains `sentry`, case-insensitive), **or** the
body contains a Sentry event URL (`https://sentry.io/`).
Proceed with Path A parsing in Step 2.

### Path B — Manual triage form
The issue was created by a human via the **Manual Triage Request** form
(`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/manual-triage.yml`).

Detect Path B by checking for the label `manual-triage` on the issue **or** by
checking that the body contains **all three** of the following `### ` section
headers (case-insensitive):

- `### Exception / Error`
- `### Issue Type`
- `### Severity`

If the `manual-triage` label is present **or** all three headers are detected,
proceed with Path B parsing in Step 2.

### Exit condition
If neither Path A nor Path B criteria are met, post **nothing**, make **no
file changes**, and stop immediately.
Output the message: `"Issue does not match any known triage path — exiting gracefully."`

### Gate 2 — Issue age check (prevent re-triage of old issues)

Fetch the `created_at` timestamp for issue `${{ github.event.issue.number }}` by running:
```bash
gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --json createdAt --jq '.createdAt'
```
Compute the elapsed time between the issue's `created_at` timestamp and the
current UTC time.

If the issue is **older than 2 hours**, post **nothing**, make **no file
changes**, and stop immediately.
Output the message: `"Issue was created more than 2 hours ago — skipping to prevent unintended re-triage."`

This guard prevents accidental re-triage when the bot is manually re-assigned
to an issue that has already been processed.



---

## Step 1 — Read the project playbook

Read `.github/triage-instructions.md` in full **before** writing any code.
It contains the project structure, code-style guide, culprit-parsing rules,
the manual issue template specification, the fix-action classification table,
the deduplication instructions, and the mandatory PR template.

---

## Step 2 — Extract crash details from the issue

Fetch the full body of issue `${{ github.event.issue.number }}`.

### Path A — Sentry bot issue parsing

| Field | Where to find it |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Crash title** | The GitHub issue title: `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` |
| **Severity level** | Look for `fatal`, `error`, or `warning` (case-insensitive) in the body; default to `error` if absent |
| **Sentry URL** | The first `https://` URL containing `sentry.io` in the body |
| **Culprit** | A line identifying file and function — patterns like `tasks/views.py in delete_task` or `tasks.views in delete_task` |

Detailed parsing guidance is in `.github/triage-instructions.md §2a`.

### Path B — Manual issue parsing

Issues submitted via the GitHub Issue Form produce a structured body where each
field value appears immediately below its `### {Field Label}` heading. Parse
fields by locating the heading and reading the content on the line(s) that
follow it (up to the next `###` heading or end of body).

| Field | Heading to locate in body |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Issue type** | `### Issue Type` — value is the dropdown selection on the next line |
| **Exception** | `### Exception / Error` — value is the single line below the heading |
| **Culprit** | `### Culprit` — value is `file_path in function_name` on the next line |
| **Severity** | `### Severity` — value is the dropdown selection on the next line |
| **Affected Instance** | `### Affected Instance` — value on the next line (may be `_No response_` if skipped) |
| **Description** | `### Description` — all text between this heading and the next `###` |
| **Stack trace** | `### Stack Trace` — the code block between this heading and end of body |

**Missing fields:** If any required field is absent, do NOT refuse to triage.
Instead, continue with available fields, state the confidence level
(High / Medium / Low) at every relevant step, and list all assumptions made.
Confidence rules:
- **High** — all 4 of Exception, Culprit, Severity, Stack Trace are present
- **Medium** — Exception + Culprit present; Severity or Stack Trace missing
- **Low** — only Exception present; Culprit must be inferred from codebase search

When Culprit is missing and confidence is Low, run:
```bash
grep -rn "raise \|except " tasks/ --include="*.py"
```
and cross-reference with the Exception type to identify the most plausible
function. State your reasoning explicitly.

---

## Step 3 — Deduplication check

**Run these checks before any analysis. Stop early if a duplicate is found.**

### 3a — Duplicate issue check
Search open GitHub issues for the exception class extracted from the crash title.
If an open issue already exists with the same exception class **and** culprit
module, post a comment on the new issue:

```
## Duplicate Detected

This crash appears to be a duplicate of #<existing_issue_number>.

**Existing issue:** #<number> — <title>

No further triage will be performed. Please track this crash in the existing
issue. If this is a new recurrence or a different root cause, please re-open
or create a new issue with differentiated context.
```

Then **stop immediately**. Do not open a PR.

### 3b — Open PR check (search by culprit, not exception class)
Search open pull requests for any PR whose branch name or title references
the **culprit file** or **culprit function name** extracted in Step 2.
Also search open `fix/sentry-` branches for the function name.

If an open PR already exists that touches the crashing function:
- Post a comment on the new issue:
  ```
  ## Fix Already In Progress
  An open pull request already addresses this crash: #<pr_number>
  PR: #<pr_number> — <pr_title>
  Please review and merge that PR rather than triaging again.
  ```
- **Stop immediately.** Do not open a PR.

### 3c — Recently merged PR → regression trigger
Search merged pull requests (last 30 days) for PRs whose changed files include
the culprit file. For each match, check whether the merge **introduced the
crashing line** (see `.github/triage-instructions.md §10 Check 3` and `§11`).

- If the crashing line was **introduced by the merged PR** → `REGRESSION_DETECTED=true`. Continue triage.
- If the merged PR **fixed** the crashing line and the crash is recurring → note in the impact analysis comment, reduce confidence by one level, continue triage.

---

## Step 4 — Locate the culprit file

Using the culprit extracted in Step 2, apply the conversion rule from
`.github/triage-instructions.md §2` to determine `<file_path>` and
`<function_name>`.

Read the entire culprit file and find the exact function.

---

## Step 5 — Understand the crash

Before writing any code, answer these three questions:

1. What operation is being attempted at the crash site?
2. What exception type or failure mode occurs?
3. What guard is missing or what assumption is violated?

---

## Step 6 — Check git history and detect regressions

Follow the full procedure in `.github/triage-instructions.md §11`.

Summary:
1. `git log --oneline -15 -- <culprit_file>` — list recent commits.
2. `git show <hash> -- <culprit_file>` for each commit touching the crashing
   function — find the commit that **introduced or last modified the crashing line**.
3. Once identified, run:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state merged --search "<commit_hash>" --json number,title,mergedAt,author
   ```
   to find the merged PR that contains that commit.
4. If the PR was merged within the last 30 days and its diff introduced the
   crashing line → `REGRESSION_DETECTED=true`. Record PR number, commit hash,
   merge date, and PR author.
5. If no recent merged PR introduced the crashing line → `REGRESSION_DETECTED=false`
   (original bug, not a regression).

**Note:** A *feature* commit that adds a new unguarded `request.GET['key']`
access where that key is not always present is a regression just as much as a
commit that removes a guard — because requests that previously succeeded now
crash. Evaluate the *effect on callers*, not the *intent of the commit*.

---

## Step 7 — Post impact analysis comment

Post this comment on the GitHub issue **before taking any further action**.
Populate the affected components by running the grep commands shown.

```bash
# Run these before writing the comment
grep -rn "<function_name>" tasks/ --include="*.py"
grep -rn "@require_POST\|def get\|def post\|urlpatterns" tasks/views.py tasks/urls.py 2>/dev/null
find . -name "test_*.py" -exec grep -l "<function_name>" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

Post the comment using this exact structure:

```markdown
## Impact Analysis

**Impact Level:** {Critical / High / Medium / Low}

**Classification criteria used:**
- Critical: crash affects task creation, CSV export, or overall data integrity of the task list
- High: crash affects a core view (index, add_task, toggle_task, delete_task, export_tasks_csv)
- Medium: crash affects a secondary view (search_tasks, task_detail) or an edge-case input
- Low: crash affects a rare code path, cosmetic issue, or admin-only operation

**Affected Components:**
- Files changed or implicated: {list from grep results}
- API endpoints affected: {list any routes identified from @require_POST, def get, def post, urlpatterns}
- Background tasks affected: {this project has no background task queue — write "none"}
- Tests covering this area: {list test files found, or "none found"}

**Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| {risk description} | {High / Medium / Low} | {mitigation action} |

**QA Verification Notes:**
{Specific instructions for QA: which endpoint or flow to exercise, which instance to use, what input triggers the crash}

{If Step 3c found a merged PR that fixed (not introduced) the crashing line, add:}
> ⚠️ A merged PR (#<pr_number>) previously addressed this crash but may not be deployed yet or may have been reverted.
```

---

## Step 8 — Classify the fix action

Using the root cause identified in Step 5 and the classification table in
`.github/triage-instructions.md §8`, determine:

### Category A — No code PR needed
Applies when Axis 1 is **Data/state issue** (any Axis 2 cause),
**Race condition**, or **External dependency failure**.

1. Apply GitHub label `ops-remediation-needed` to the issue.
2. Post a comment on the issue using this exact structure:

```markdown
## Automated Triage Analysis

**Root Cause — Axis 1:** {state type}
**Root Cause — Axis 2:** {cause type, if applicable}
**Fix Type:** No code change required

### Why No PR Was Created
{Clear explanation of why this is not a code fix and what the actual problem is}

### Operational Remediation Steps
1. {step 1}
2. {step 2}

### Script to Run
**Script:** `{Django management command or SQLite CLI — this project has no support_scripts/ directory}`
**Command:** `{exact command}`
**Target instance:** `{subdomain or instance identifier}`
**Expected outcome:** {what should happen after running it}

### Affected Instances
{List any instance subdomains identified from Sentry context or issue body}

### Confidence Level
{High / Medium / Low} — {justification}
```

3. **Stop here.** Do not open a PR. Do not generate tests. Skip Steps 9–11.

### Category B — Code PR needed
Applies when Axis 1 is **Code defect**.

1. Apply GitHub label `sentry-triage-code-fix` to the **issue**.
2. Apply GitHub label `sentry-triage-code-fix` to the **PR** created in Step 11.
3. Continue to Steps 9–11.

---

## Step 9 — Apply the fix (Category B only)

Rules:
- Make the **smallest correct change** possible — touch only the crashing function
- Match the existing code style exactly (see `.github/triage-instructions.md §4`)
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code, change formatting, or add new dependencies
- Do NOT modify `migrations/` unless the crash originates there

---

## Step 10 — Generate tests (Category B only)

Follow the instructions in `.github/agents/test-generator.agent.md` exactly.

The test file must be placed in the correct test directory following the
existing test structure:
- For `tasks/` app functions: place tests in `tasks/tests.py` (or
  `tasks/tests/test_<module>.py` if the tests directory already exists)

The tests must cover **at minimum**:
1. **Crash scenario** — confirm the bug is reproducible before the fix
   (parametrize with the exact input that triggered the crash)
2. **Fix scenario** — confirm the fix resolves the crash
3. **At least one edge case** related to the fix

Follow all conventions from `.github/agents/test-generator.agent.md`:
- Use `django.test.TestCase` — **no pytest**, no `@pytest.mark.django_db`
- Use `self.client` for all HTTP requests — no raw view calls
- Use `setUpTestData` for read-only shared data; `setUp` for mutable data
- Every test method must have a one-line docstring
- Focus on HTTP contract and DB side-effects, not implementation details

---

## Step 11 — Open a Draft Pull Request (Category B only)

Create a branch named `fix/sentry-<slug>-${{ github.run_id }}` where `<slug>` is
the crash title lowercased with spaces and special characters replaced by
hyphens (max 45 chars for the slug — the run ID will be appended automatically).

The PR **must** be a **draft**. Use this description format exactly:

````markdown
## 🔴 Sentry Crash Fix

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Crash title** | <title from issue> |
| **Culprit** | `<culprit>` |
| **Severity** | <level> |
| **Sentry URL** | [View crash](PASTE_FULL_SENTRY_HTTPS_URL_HERE_NO_ANGLE_BRACKETS) |
| **Triage issue** | Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }} |
| **Source** | {Sentry bot / Manual triage} |
| **Triage confidence** | {High / Medium / Low — only include for Path B manual issues} |

> **IMPORTANT for Sentry URL**: Replace `PASTE_FULL_SENTRY_HTTPS_URL_HERE_NO_ANGLE_BRACKETS` with the raw full URL exactly as extracted, e.g. `https://demo3n.sentry.io/organizations/...`. Do NOT wrap it in angle brackets `<>`. The format must be exactly `[View crash](https://...)` with no extra parentheses or brackets.

## Root Cause

<One clear paragraph: what went wrong, what input triggered it, what guard was missing>

## Fix Applied

<One paragraph: what was changed and why it prevents the crash>

## Changed Files

- `<file>` — <one-line description>

## Before / After

```python
# Before
<original code>

# After
<fixed code>
```

## Tests Added

- `<test_file_path>` — crash scenario: {description}
- `<test_file_path>` — fix scenario: {description}
- `<test_file_path>` — edge case: {description}

## Risk Assessment

- **Side effects:** <none or describe>
- **Edge cases covered:** <list>
- **Edge cases NOT covered (requires follow-up):** <none or list>

{— Include the following section ONLY if REGRESSION_DETECTED=true —}

## Regression Detection

**Introducing commit:** `{commit_hash}`
**Author:** @{github_username}
**Associated PR:** #{pr_number} (if found, otherwise "not found")
**Date introduced:** {commit date}

**Rollback command:**
```bash
git revert {commit_hash}
```

**Recommendation:** {Fix forward — explain why} OR {Rollback — explain why}
````

The `Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}` line ensures the triggering
GitHub issue is auto-closed when the PR is merged.

### Reviewer assignment

Always request review from the GitHub team **`ramya-co/ops-team`**.

Additionally, if `REGRESSION_DETECTED=true`, also request review from the
individual GitHub user `@{github_username}` identified as the author of the
regression-introducing commit.

Do NOT merge the PR. Leave it as a draft for the human engineer to review,
approve, and merge.

---

## Step 12 — Apply PR Label and Assign Reviewer

After the PR is created, load and follow the reviewer assignment skill.

1. Read `.github/skills/reviewer-assignment.md` in full. This is an
   autonomous CI run — do not pause, do not ask for confirmation, and
   do not wait for input. Execute all steps in it immediately.

2. You already know which files you modified to produce the fix. Use
   that list directly — do not re-scan the repo.
